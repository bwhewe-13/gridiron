# gridiron

This package uses pygame to interact with a two-dimensional array and convert it to a npy file. The primary use for this is with the two-dimensional neutron transport code.

### To Do List
- [ ] Add x-y labels on the grid
- [ ] Allow for dragging the mouse across multiple cells
- [ ] Selecting specific materials for each cell
- [ ] Use cell widths as input instead of number of cells
- [ ] Add a render option to show grid with correct cells sizes
